        <h2>About the Site</h2>
        <p>This site was originally created as a playground for getting to know web technologies like Angular.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides services around the word processor "LaTex": A letter assistant, for example, lets you write your letters with the help of an assistant and produces documents based on the LaTex package "scrlttr2".</p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>During his academic years Florian has worked a lot with LaTex to create publications, presentations, posters, and his theses. It was this time during which his enthusiasm for that word processor and document markup language has evolved. Having left the academics, the usage of LaTex has decreased for him and this site preserves at least a little piece of the everyday beauty of Latex.</p>
